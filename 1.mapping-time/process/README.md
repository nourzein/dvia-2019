# Sketch 1: Circular time 
![Circular time](https://github.com/nourzein/dvia-2019/blob/master/1.mapping-time/process/circulartime.png)
In this interactive depication of time, I use 'acr()' to draw three circles, one for seconds, minutes, and hours. 
I use the 'map()' function to "map" the radius of the circles to the length of time for each unit.  

# Sketch 2: Bar Clock
![bar clock](https://github.com/nourzein/dvia-2019/blob/master/1.mapping-time/barclock.png)
I use 3 bars, one for seconds, minutes and hours. They full up accourding to there respective times. The color intensity is a way to distinguish the time, since they are all bars. 

# Sketch 3: Bar Clock2

I also use the concept of bars for this one, but the bars move freely.

# Sketch 4: Planetary Clock
![Planet Clock](https://github.com/nourzein/dvia-2019/blob/master/1.mapping-time/planetclock.png)
I use earth as the center with a small orbit of the moon representing months, and a much bigger orbit of the sun represting years.

# Sketch 7: Date Clock
![date clock](https://github.com/nourzein/dvia-2019/blob/master/1.mapping-time/process/date_clock.png)
I use the symbol of a normal clock to depict date. The longest is the progress of a day (hours), the second longer hand is progress of a month (days), and the shortest is the progress of a year (months). 

# Sketch 6: Seasonal Clock
![Clock](https://github.com/nourzein/dvia-2019/blob/master/1.mapping-time/process/seasonal_clock.png)
This depiction I used colors to signify different seasons passing and circular lines for months. The entire clock is one year.
I use blueish purple palette for winter, yellowish orange for spring, green for summer, and reddish copper for fall.

# Sketch 7: Infinity Hourglass
![Infinity hourglass](https://github.com/nourzein/dvia-2019/blob/master/1.mapping-time/hourglass_seasons%2Byears.png)
In this static depiction, I use illustrator to show seasons passing in a year glass. The hourglass movement of sand represents full year, the colors inside the hourglass follow the colors of the seasons, from fall- summer. 
I added the element of the infinity sign as the hourglass shape to represent an inifite number of years.
