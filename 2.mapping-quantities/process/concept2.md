# Concept 2: Main explores and blast radius, compared to Manhattan.

For this concept, I first summarized the entire tests by country to see how the data looks like. Then I thought about the top most destructive testing events and what they looked like, but for this I needed to do some googling. 
I created a sketch on how to show the most destructive explosions in terms of blast radius, comparing it to where we are (New School).
