# Sketch 1: Effect of Treaties

![treaties](https://github.com/nourzein/dvia-2019/blob/master/2.mapping-quantities/process/line_graph_timeline.jpeg)

I want to show the effect of treaties using a timeline.

# Sketch 2: Nuclear Pop Culture

![pop_culture](https://github.com/nourzein/dvia-2019/blob/master/2.mapping-quantities/process/nuclear_popculture.jpeg)

I want to show the effect of nuclear testing on pop culture.

# Sketch 3: Blast Radius

I want to compare the top nuclear explosion blasts to each other and to new york city.

# Sketch 1: Treaties Updated

Instead of doing a simple line graph for treaties, I will try to use retinal variables.
These are two different variations of treaties data.
